orchestartion/ko.py
-------------------

This is a python script to orchestrate kubernetes and
kolla-kubernetes. It follows the bare metal deployment guide quite
strictly. Because it is not data-driven and basically does too much it
belongs in contrib. It has been used by some in the community to gain
a quick appreciation of kolla-kubernetes.
